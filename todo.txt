1. make credentials provider work with mongodb adapter : https://nneko.branche.online/next-auth-credentials-provider-with-the-database-session-strategy/
-> fix ; 
session: { // Set it as jwt instead of database strategy: "jwt", },

as note that if you want to persist the credentials session, you need to set session.strategy as 'jwt'. Credentials provider does not persist the session in the database.

The Credentials provider can only be used if JSON Web Tokens are enabled for sessions. Users authenticated with the Credentials provider are not persisted in the database. https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/credentials


using this will make credentials work but session will not persist , so google provider is not working, need fixes ...
